# GA

- differentials define linear, adjoint
- matrix algebra is subalgebra to GA; $a_{ik}=e_i \dot a_k$ as a inner product of two n-vectors and determinants as expansions -> Cramers rule to solve Ax=b (which is usually taught to be solved by Gaussian matrix algorithm, but can be solved with $A^{-1}=\frac{adj(A)}{det(A)})
- Tensors defined as frame independent linear function
- nothing special with Paulis
- python: clifford, galgebra
